        <h2>Investopedia</h2>
    </div>
           <div class="card-body">
        <p>Investing in stocks in difficult, but it is a great long-term strategy for accumulating wealth.</p>
        <p>Stocks have historically outperformed other investments, such as bonds, commodities, CDs (Certificates of Deposit), savings accounts, etc.</p>
        <p>When investing in stocks, there are two different approaches: <b>passive</b> and <b>active</b>.</p>
        <p>Passive investing means buying broad-market index funds or ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) and holding on to them for the long-term (5+ years). </p>
        <p>Active investing means taking a more hands-on approach by picking individual stocks to purchase and trading at a reasonable frequency (not day-trading!).</p>
        <p>Combining both approaches is actually a great tool, as some of your assets are tracking major indices (passive investments), while you are also keeping track of individual stocks to purchase/sell based on market conditions and trends.</p>


        <h3  class="card-body-heading">52-Week High/Low</h3>
        <p>The <strong>52-week high</strong> refers to the highest market price of a given security over a 52-week (one year) period.</p>
        <p>The 52-week high serves as an indicator for potential investors. Investor's will often reference the 52-week high for a stock when looking at the current price.</p>
            <p>While it may be tempting to think that you should buy a stock when it's close to it's <strong>52-week low</strong> and sell when it's close to its 52-week high, this approach isn't guaranteed to work.</p>
        <p>In fact, a lot of great stocks will trade near there 52-week high as their stock price continues to rise.</p>

        <h3 class="card-body-heading">Market Capitalization</h3>

        <p>Market capitalization (or market cap) is the total value of the tradable shares of a publicly traded company; it is equal to the share price times the number of shares outstanding. As outstanding stock is bought and sold in public markets, capitalization could be used as a proxy for the public opinion of a company's net worth and is a determining factor in some forms of stock valuation. Preferred shares are included in the calculation.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>Rule of thumb for different cap classes:</summary>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mega-cap: </strong> Over $200 billion</li>
            <li><strong>Large-cap: </strong> Over $10 billion</li>
            <li><strong>Mid-cap: </strong> $2 billion–$10 billion</li>
            <li><strong>Small-cap: </strong> $250 million–$2 billion</li>
            <li><strong>Micro-cap: </strong> Below $250 million</li>
            <li><strong>Nano-cap: </strong> Below $50 million</li>
        </ul>
        </details>

        <h3 class="card-body-heading">Dividends</h3>
        <p>Dividends are payments that a company makes to its shareholders (people that own its stock). It is a good alternative to generate passive income.</p>
        <p>Typically, larger and well-established companies will pay out dividends.</p>
        <p>There is a sub-category of investing that focuses entirely on investing in dividend-paying stocks for long-term investing.</p>
        <p>A quick metric to check for a company is the <strong>Dividend Yield</strong>, which is a financial ratio that tells you the percentage of a company's share price that it pays out in dividends each year.</p>
        <p>Dividend yield = (Annual Dividend per share)/ (Current share price) * 100</p>


        <h3 class="card-body-heading">Price-to-Earnings (PE) Ratio</h3>
        <p>The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS). The price-to-earnings ratio is also sometimes known as the price multiple or the earnings multiple.</p>
        <p>P/E ratios are used by investors and analysts to determine the relative value of a company's shares in an apples-to-apples comparison. It can also be used to compare a company against its own historical record or to compare aggregate markets against one another or over time.</p>
            <p>Usually a company with a PE Ratio of or below 20 is considered <strong>undervalued</strong> whereas a company with a PE Ratio of or above 40 is considered <strong>overvalued</strong></p>

            <h3 class="card-body-heading">Return On Equity (ROE) Ratio</h3>
        <p>ROE is a <strong>profitability ratio</strong>that signifies the rate of return a shareholder receives for the portion of their investment in that company. It measures how well a company generates positive returns to its shareholders’ investment.</p>
        <p> Since profit is an actual driver of stock prices, separating out the profits earned with shareholder equity is actually a pretty good indicator of the financial health of a company and fair value of its stock.</p>
            <p>ROE is a gauge of a corporation's profitability and how efficiently it generates those profits.</p>

        <h3 class="card-body-heading">Price-to-Earnings-Growth (PEG) Ratio</h3>
        <p>The PEG Ratio takes the P/E Ratio and incorporates the expected earnings growth to provide a valuation of a company.</p>
        <p>At a high-level, a PEG Ratio can be interpreted as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>< 1.0 - indicates that a stock is undervalued</li>
            <li>> 1.0 - indicates a stock is overvalued</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, the PEG ratio can vary from industry to industry and it fluctuates based on overall market conditions as well.</p>
        <p>It's best to use the PEG ratio when comparing companies in similar industries (ie. Home Depot vs. Lowes)</p>
        <p>More information: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/peg-ratio/">Forbes - What Is the PEG Ratio?</a></p>


        <h3 class="card-body-heading">Price-to-Book (PB) Ratio</h3>
        <p>The book value of a company is the value of its assets minus its liabilities (which can be found in a company's balance sheet).</p>
        <p>One of the key concepts of value investing is finding stocks that are under-priced. The book value of a company is often used to find under-priced stocks.</p>
        <p>The Price-to-Book Value ratio is a good metric for comparing companies in similar industries.</p>

            <h3 class="card-body-heading">Debt-to-Equity (DE) Ratio</h3>
        <p>The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is used to evaluate a company's financial leverage and is calculated by dividing a company’s total liabilities by its shareholder equity.</p>
            <p>It is a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations through debt versus wholly owned funds.</p>
<p>However, the D/E ratio is difficult to compare across industry groups where ideal amounts of debt will vary.</p>
            <p>Investors will often modify the D/E ratio to focus on long-term debt only because the risks associated with long-term liabilities are different than short-term debt and payables.</p>

            <h3 class="card-body-heading">Earnings Per Share (EPS)</h3>
            <p>This is the portion of a company’s profit that is assigned to each share of its stock. It’s essentially the bottom line net income, just on a per-share basis.</p>
            <p>A growing EPS is a <strong> good sign</strong> to investors because it means that their shares are likely to be worth more.</p>
            <p>We can calculate the earnings per share of a company by dividing its total profit by the number of outstanding shares.</p>

<h3 class="card-body-heading">Free Cash Flow (FCF)</h3>
            <p>In simplest terms, Free Cash Flow is the cash left over after a company has paid for its operating expenses and capital expenditures.</p>
<p>Companies with high free cash flow can improve shareholder value, fund innovation, and survive downturns better than their less-liquid counterparts.</p>
            <p>Many investors cherish FCF as a fundamental indicator because it shows whether a company still has enough cash to reward its shareholders through dividends after funding operations and capital expenditures.</p>


            <h3 class="card-body-heading">Profit Margin</h3>
        <p>Profit margin indicates the percentage of sales that get turned into profits. This metric gauges how well a company is making money.</p>
        <p>This metric quickly indicates if a company is profitable or not. As with the PEG Ratio, profit margins vary by industry.</p>
